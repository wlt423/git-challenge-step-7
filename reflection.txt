Well I still don't understand git too well. I guess enough to push my assignments. It seems very counterintuitive to me, and I don't do anything that requires such version control so I've always tried to avoid it. I mucked through this assignment, haveing worked on it a few times here and there for a few weeks.
Ill probably just have to keep using it until i'm comfortable with it.
